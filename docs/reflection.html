            <p>One of the most significant challenges faced for someone learning HTML for the first time is truly understanding what the code you’re writing down means. It’s one thing to just write it down, it’s another to actually know how the code you’re inputting will function. Taking the time to practice with different lines of code for fun turned out to be incredibly helpful in allowing me to understand what I was executing. Some advantages I found utilizing the WordPress format rather than using HTML were the templates and ease of use. It’s easy to see the website was founded on the ability to be utilized by anyone, even those who aren’t familiar with coding.</p> 
                
            <p>I found the biggest challenge to modifying the layout and organization of each site was attempting to create a style I could be definitively proud of. I found myself constantly slightly changing certain lines of code just so it could line up perfectly with what I had imagined. It turned out to be incredibly time-consuming. I found during my time developing both websites that patience was a skill absolutely necessary, during the process, there’s a lot of debugging to be done as well as experimenting to see what works and what does not. It’s not a quick and easy process, it takes time and a lot of practice to eventually get what you want.</p>
                
            <p>A common problem that popped up during the time I worked on this project was losing track of my code or what the different entries were meant to do. I often had to go and search up what different lines of code did and retest old entries to make sure I know what was going on. I certainly need to continue working with HTML and start memorizing what the different entries mean. It’s not required for me to remember what to write down every time, but as long as I understand what I’m putting into my file I believe that will help significantly.</p>
