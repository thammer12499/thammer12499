            <p>     I was diagnosed with autism at a young age, naturally I faced many hardships both
                academically and socially. I often had to have equations and problems explained to
                me in detail and struggled grasp certain concepts, to this day Math still kicks my
                ass. Socially I was what some would call the "weird kid". I didn't understand or
                pick up on many social ques, much of the time I was playing catch up to everyone
                else and often dealt with bullying as a result. This unfortunately began to develop
                into a social anxiety where I further isolated myself. </p>
            <p>     After school I decided to immediately go into the workforce, I was exhausted and
                needed to get a taste of what the real world was like. After working 3 separate jobs
                I found myself realizing that working low paying dead-end jobs was not what I wanted
                to do for the rest of my life. I decided to pursue my passion that I had slowly been
                developing over the years in digital media and the arts. My love for video games and
                movies growing up is nurtured my desire to create something of my own eventually,
                and with finally having my the rest of my life ahead of me, my decision became
                clear.</p> 
                <p> I started my Freshman year at Penn State Behrend majoring in Digital Media,
                Arts, and Technology where I currently continue my studies to one day create
                something of my own for people to look up to and enjoy.</p>
