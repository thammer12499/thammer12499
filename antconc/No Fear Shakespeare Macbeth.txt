We’ll meet when the noise of the battle is over,  when one side has won and the other side has  lost.

That will happen before sunset.

Alarum within. Enter KING  
DUNCAN, MALCOLM,DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with  attendants, meeting a bleeding CAPTAIN 
DUNCAN 
What bloody man is that? He can report,  
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt  
The newest state.  
MALCOLM 
 This is the sergeant  
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought  
Sounds of a trumpet and soldiers fighting  offstage. KING DUNCAN enters with his  sonsMALCOLM and DONALBAIN, LENNOX,  and a number of attendants. They meet a  wounded and bloody CAPTAIN.  
DUNCAN 
Who is this bloody man? Judging from his  appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news  about the revolt.  
MALCOLM 
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me  from being captured. Hail, brave friend! Tell the

And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald—  10 
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that  
The multiplying villanies of nature  
Do swarm upon him—from the Western Isles  Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,  
And fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling,  15 
Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak,  For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name—  Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel,  Which smoked with bloody execution,  
Like valor’s minion carved out his passage  Till he faced the slave;  
20 
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,  Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,  And fixed his head upon our battlements.  DUNCAN 
O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!  
clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move. The villainous rebel Macdonwald  was supported by foot soldiers and horsemen  from Ireland and the Hebrides, and Lady Luck  was with him, smiling cruelly at his enemies as if  she were his whore. But Luck and Macdonwald  together weren’t strong enough. Brave Macbeth,  laughing at Luck, chopped his way through to  Macdonwald, who didn’t even have time to say  good-bye or shake hands before Macbeth split  him open from his navel to his jawbone and stuck  his head on our castle walls.  
DUNCAN 
My brave relative! What a worthy man!

As whence the sun 'gins his reflection  
Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,  So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come  Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:  No sooner justice had, with valor armed,  
30 
Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,  But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,  With furbished arms and new supplies of men,  Began a fresh assault.  
DUNCAN 
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and  Banquo?  
CAPTAIN 
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.  
35 
If I say sooth, I must report they were  
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,  So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.  Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,  40 
Or memorize another Golgotha,  
I cannot tell—  
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.  
DUNCAN 
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;  They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.  
But in the same way that violent storms always  come just as spring appears, our success against  Macdonwald created new problems for us. Listen  to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish  soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king  saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and  shiny weapons.  
DUNCAN 
Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and  Banquo?  
CAPTAIN 
The new challenge scared them about as much  as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a  lion. To tell you the truth, they fought the new  enemy with twice as much force as before; they  were like cannons loaded with double  ammunition. Maybe they wanted to take a bath in  their enemies' blood, or make that battlefield as  infamous as Golgotha, where Christ was  crucified, I don’t know. But I feel weak. My  wounds must be tended to.  
DUNCAN 
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.  Take him to the surgeons.

ROSS 
 God save the king.  
DUNCAN 
Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?  
ROSS 
 From Fife, great king,  
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky  
His eyes seem frantic! He looks like someone  with a strange tale to tell.  
ROSS 
God save the king!  
DUNCAN 
Where have you come from, worthy thane?  ROSS 
Great king, I’ve come from Fife, where the  Norwegian flag flies, mocking our country and  
50 
And fan our people cold.  
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,  
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,  
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,  Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof,  55 
Confronted him with self-comparisons,  
Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,  Curbing his lavish spirit; and to conclude,  
The victory fell on us.  
DUNCAN 
 Great happiness!  
ROSS 
 That now  
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition.  60 
Nor would we deign him burial of his men  
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch  
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.  
DUNCAN 
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive  Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, 65 
And with his former title greet Macbeth.  
ROSS 
I’ll see it done.  
DUNCAN 
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.  
frightening our people. Leading an enormous  army and assisted by that disloyal traitor, the  thane of Cawdor, the king of Norway began a  
bloody battle. But outfitted in his battle-weathered  armor, Macbeth met the Norwegian attacks shot  for shot, as if he were the goddess of war’s  husband. Finally he broke the enemy’s spirit, and  we were victorious.  
DUNCAN 
Great happiness!  
ROSS 
So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a  treaty. We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury  his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch  and paid us ten thousand dollars.  
DUNCAN 
The thane of Cawdor will never again betray me.  Go announce that he will be executed, and tell  Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him.  ROSS 
I’ll get it done right away.  
DUNCAN 
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble  Macbeth has won.

How far is it supposed to be to Forres? (he sees  the WITCHES) What are these creatures?  They’re so withered-looking and crazily dressed.  They don’t look like they belong on this planet,  but I see them standing here on Earth. (to  theWITCHES) Are you alive? Can you answer  questions? You seem to understand me, because  each of you has put a gruesome finger to her  skinny lips. You look like women, but your beards  keep me from believing that you really are.

BANQUO 
My dear Macbeth, why do you look so startled  and afraid of these nice things they’re saying?(to  the WITCHES) Tell me honestly, are you  illusions, or are you really what you seem to be?  You’ve greeted my noble friend with honors and  talk of a future so glorious that you’ve made him  speechless. But you don’t say anything to me. If  you can see the future and say how things will  turn out, tell me. I don’t want your favors and I’m not afraid of your hatred.

Stands not within the prospect of belief,  
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence  You owe this strange intelligence, or why  Upon this blasted heath you stop our way  With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you.  
FIRST WITCH 
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!  
MACBETH 
Wait! You only told me part of what I want to  know. Stay and tell me more. I already know I am  the thane of Glamis because I inherited the  position when my father, Sinel, died. But how can  you call me the thane of Cawdor? The thane of  Cawdor is alive, and he’s a rich and powerful  man. And for me to be the king is completely  impossible, just as it’s impossible for me to be  thane of Cawdor. Tell me where you learned  these strange things, and why you stop us at this  desolate place with this prophetic greeting?  Speak, I command you.

The king hath happily received, Macbeth,  The news of thy success, and when he reads  Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,  His wonders and his praises do contend  Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,  In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,  He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,  Strange images of death. As thick as tale  Can post with post, and every one did bear  Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,  
ROSS 
The king was happy to hear of your success,  Macbeth. Whenever he hears the story of your  exploits in the fight against the rebels, he  becomes so amazed it makes him speechless.  He was also shocked to learn that on the same  day you fought the rebels you also fought against  the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the  least bit afraid of death, even as you killed  everyone around you. Messenger after  messenger delivered news of your bravery to the  king with praise for how you defended his

BANQUO 
 What, can the devil speak true?  MACBETH 
The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me  In borrowed robes?  
ANGUS 
 Who was the thane lives yet,  But under heavy judgment bears that life  Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was  combined  
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel  With hidden help and vantage, or that with both  He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not;  But treasons capital, confessed and proved,  Have overthrown him.  
ANGUS 
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to  bring you to him. Your real reward won’t come  from us.  
ROSS 
And to give you a taste of what’s in store for you, he told me to call you the thane of Cawdor. So  hail, thane of Cawdor! That title belongs to you  now.  
BANQUO 
(shocked) Can the devil tell the truth?  MACBETH 
The thane of Cawdor is still alive. Why are you  putting his clothes on me?  
ANGUS 
The man who was the thane of Cawdor is still  alive, but he’s been sentenced to death, and he  deserves to die. I don’t know whether he fought  on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the  rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies.  But his treason, which has been proven, and to  which he’s confessed, means he’s finished.

In deepest consequence.

the best part of what they predicted is still to  come. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Thank you for the  news. (speaking so that only BANQUO can  hear) Aren’t you beginning to hope your children  will be kings? After all, the witches who said I  was thane of Cawdor promised them nothing  less.  
BANQUO 
If you trust what they say, you might be on your  way to becoming king, as well as thane of  Cawdor. But this whole thing is strange. The  agents of evil often tell us part of the truth in  order to lead us to our destruction. They earn our  trust by telling us the truth about little things, but  then they betray us when it will damage us the  most.

If it’s a bad  thing, why was I promised a promotion that  turned out to be true? Now I’m the thane of  Cawdor, just like they said I would be. But if this is a good thing, why do I find myself thinking  about murdering King Duncan, a thought so  horrifying that it makes my hair stand on end and  my heart pound inside my chest?

As one that had been studied in his death  
To throw away the dearest thing he owed  
10 
As ’twere a careless trifle.  
DUNCAN 
 There’s no art  
To find the mind’s construction in the face.  
He was a gentleman on whom I built  
An absolute trust.  
A trumpet fanfare sounds. KING  
DUNCAN,LENNOX, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,  and their attendants enter.  
DUNCAN 
Has the former thane of Cawdor been executed  yet? Haven’t the people in charge of that come  back?  
MALCOLM 
My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke  with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said  that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons,  begged your highness’s forgiveness, and  repented deeply. He never did anything in his  whole life that looked as good as the way he died.  He died like someone who had practiced how to  toss away his most cherished possession as if it  were a worthless a piece of garbage.  
DUNCAN 
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking  at his face. I trusted Cawdor completely.  
Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUSenter.  
(to MACBETH) O worthiest cousin,  
15 
The sin of my ingratitude even now  
Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before  That swiftest wing of recompense is slow  To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,  20 
That the proportion both of thanks and payment  Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,  More is thy due than more than all can pay.  
(to MACBETH) My worthiest kinsman! Just this  moment I was feeling guilty for not having  thanked you enough. You have done so much for  me so fast that it has been impossible to reward  you properly. If you deserved less, then perhaps  my payment would have matched your deeds! All  I can say is that I owe you more than I can ever  repay.  
Act 1, Scene 4, Page 2  
MACBETH 
The service and the loyalty I owe  
In doing it pays itself. Your highness' part  
MACBETH 
The opportunity to serve you is its own reward.  Your only duty, your highness, is to accept what  
Is to receive our duties, and our duties  
25 
Are to your throne and state children and servants, Which do but what they should, by doing everything  Safe toward your love and honor.  
DUNCAN 
 Welcome hither.  
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor  
To make thee full of growing. (to BANQUO) Noble  
30 
Banquo,  
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known  
we owe you. Our duty to you and your state is like  the duty of children to their father or servants to their master. By doing everything we can to  protect you, we’re only doing what we should.  DUNCAN 
You are welcome here. By making you thane of  Cawdor, I have planted the seeds of a great  career for you, and I will make sure they  grow. (toBANQUO) Noble Banquo, you deserve  no less than Macbeth, and everyone should know 
No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -10-   Original Text Modern Text  
No less to have done so, let me infold thee  And hold thee to my heart.  
BANQUO 
 There, if I grow,  
The harvest is your own.  
DUNCAN 
 My plenteous joys,  
35 
Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves  In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,  And you whose places are the nearest, know  We will establish our estate upon  
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter  40 
The prince of Cumberland; which honor must  Not unaccompanied invest him only,  
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine  On all deservers. (to MACBETH) From hence to  Inverness,  
And bind us further to you.  
MACBETH 
The rest is labor which is not used for you:

it. Let me bring you close to me and give you the  benefit of my love and good will.  
BANQUO 
Then if I accomplish anything great, it will be a  credit to you.  
DUNCAN 
My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my  eyes. My sons, relatives, lords, and all those  closest to me, I want you to witness that I will  bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm.  Today I name him the prince of Cumberland. But  Malcolm isn’t going to be alone in receiving  honors—titles of nobility will shine like stars on all  of you who deserve them. (to MACBETH) And  now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness, where I  will become even more obliged to you because of  your hospitality.  
MACBETH 
I’m not happy unless I can be working for you. I  will go ahead and bring my wife the good news  that you are coming. With that, I’ll be off.  
DUNCAN 
My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH 
(aside) The prince of Cumberland! That is a step  
50 
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,  For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;  Let not light see my black and deep desires.  The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be  55 
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.  
DUNCAN 
True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,  And in his commendations I am fed;  
It is a banquet to me.—Let’s after him,  
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:  60 
It is a peerless kinsman.  
(to himself) Malcolm is now the prince of  
Cumberland! To become king myself, I’m either  going to have to step over him or give up,  
because he’s in my way. Stars, hide your light so  no one can see the terrible desires within me. I  won’t let my eye look at what my hand is doing,  but in the end I’m still going to do that thing I’d be  horrified to see.  
Exit MACBETH exits.  DUNCAN 
(to BANQUO, in the middle of a conversation we  haven’t heard) You’re right, Banquo. Macbeth is  every bit as valiant as you say, and I am satisfied 
with these praises of him. Let’s follow after him,  now that he has gone ahead to prepare our  welcome. He is a man without equal.

in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in  desire to question them further, they made  themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I  stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the  king, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and  referred me to the coming on of time with 'Hail, king  that shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou  might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being  ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to  thy heart, and farewell.”  
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be  What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;  It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness

supernatural knowledge. When I tried desperately  to question them further, they vanished into thin  air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from  the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of  Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters  had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!' I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest  partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice  along with me about the greatness that is  promised to us. Keep it secret, and farewell.”  
(she looks up from the letter) You are thane of  Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king,  just like you were promised. But I worry about  whether or not you have what it takes to seize the  crown. You are too full of the milk of human  kindness to strike aggressively at your first  opportunity. You want to be powerful, and you  don’t lack ambition, but you don’t have the mean  streak that these things call for. The things you  want to do, you want to do like a good man. You  don’t want to cheat, yet you want what doesn’t  belong to you. There’s something you want, but  you’re afraid to do what you need to do to get it.  You want it to be done for you. Hurry home so I  can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s  keeping you from going after the crown. After all,  fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be  king.

 My dearest love,  
Great thane of Glamis! Worthy thane of Cawdor!  You’ll soon be greater than both those titles, once you become king! Your letter has transported me  from the present moment, when who knows what  will happen, and has made me feel like the future  is already here.

Greet the king with a welcoming expression in  your eyes, your hands, and your words. You  should look like an innocent flower, but be like the  snake that hides underneath the flower. The king  is coming, and he’s got to be taken care of. Let  me handle tonight’s preparations, because  tonight will change every night and day for the  rest of our lives.

The fact that this summer bird, the house martin,  builds his nests here proves how inviting the  breezes are. There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their  hanging nests to sleep and breed.

Everything we’re doing for you, even if it were  doubled and then doubled again, is nothing  compared to the honors you have brought to our  family. We gladly welcome you as our guests, with  gratitude for both the honors you’ve given us before  and the new honors you’ve just given us.

10 
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice  To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:  First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,  Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,  Who should against his murderer shut the door,  
15 
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan  Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been  So clear in his great office, that his virtues  Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against  The deep damnation of his taking-off;  
20 
And pity, like a naked newborn babe,

preventing any consequences, then the murder  would be the be-all and end-all of the whole affair,  and I would gladly put my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like these there are still  punishments in this world. By committing violent  crimes we only teach other people to commit  violence, and the violence of our students will  come back to plague us teachers. Justice, being  equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the  poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king  trusts me in two ways. First of all, I am his  kinsman and his subject, so I should always try to  protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be  closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been  such a humble leader, so free of corruption, that  his virtuous legacy will speak for him when he  dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against  the injustice of his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind with winged  angels on invisible horses through the air to  spread news of the horrible deed to everyone  everywhere. People will shed a flood of tears that  will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of  rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing motivating me is ambition, which makes people  rush ahead of themselves toward disaster.

Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,  35 
Not cast aside so soon.  
LADY MACBETH 
 Was the hope drunk  
Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?  And wakes it now, to look so green and pale  At what it did so freely? From this time  
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard  
40 
To be the same in thine own act and valor  As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that  Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,  And live a coward in thine own esteem,  
Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would, ”

Like the poor cat i' th' adage?  
MACBETH 
 Prithee, peace:  
I dare do all that may become a man;  
Who dares do more is none.  
LADY MACBETH 
 What beast was ’t, then,  
That made you break this enterprise to me?  When you durst do it, then you were a man;  50 
And to be more than what you were, you would  Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.  They have made themselves, and that their fitness  now  
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know  
55 
How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me.  I would, while it was smiling in my face,  
Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums  And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you  Have done to this.  
LADY MACBETH 
Don’t you know he has?  
MACBETH 
We can’t go on with this plan. The king has just  honored me, and I have earned the good opinion  of all sorts of people. I want to enjoy these honors  while the feeling is fresh and not throw them  away so soon.  
LADY MACBETH 
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful  before? Have you gone to sleep and woken up  green and pale in fear of this idea? From now on  this is what I’ll think of your love. Are you afraid to  act the way you desire? Will you take the crown  you want so badly, or will you live as a coward,  always saying “I can’t” after you say “I want to”?  You’re like the poor cat in the old story.  
MACBETH 
Please, stop! I dare to do only what is proper for a  man to do. He who dares to do more is not a man  at all.  
LADY MACBETH 
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal  were you when you first told me you wanted to do  this? When you dared to do it, that’s when you  were a man. And if you go one step further by  doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be that  much more the man. The time and place weren’t  right before, but you would have gone ahead with  the murder anyhow. Now the time and place are  just right, but they’re almost too good for you. I  have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is  to love the baby at my breast. But even as the  baby was smiling up at me, I would have plucked  my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its brains  out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the  same way you have sworn to do this.

BANQUO 
What, sir, not yet at rest? The king’s a-bed.  He hath been in unusual pleasure, and  Sent forth great largess to your offices.  This diamond he greets your wife withal,  15 
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up  In measureless content.  
MACBETH 
 Being unprepared,  
Our will became the servant to defect,  Which else should free have wrought.  
BANQUO 
You’re not asleep yet, sir? The king’s in bed. He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted  many gifts to your household and servants. This  diamond is a present from him to your wife for her  boundless hospitality. (he hands MACBETH a  diamond)

Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit,  we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we  would have wanted to.

To you they have showed some truth.  MACBETH 
 I think not of them.  
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,  We would spend it in some words upon that  business,  
If you would grant the time.  
BANQUO 
 At your kind’st leisure.  MACBETH 
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,  It shall make honor for you.  
BANQUO 
 So I lose none  
In seeking to augment it, but still keep  My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,  I shall be counselled.  
MACBETH 
Good repose the while!  
BANQUO 
Thanks, sir: the like to you!  
about you was true.  
MACBETH 
I don’t think about them now. But when we have  an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if  you’re willing.  
BANQUO 
Whenever you like.  
MACBETH 
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there  will be something in it for you.  
BANQUO 
I’ll do whatever you say, as long as I can do it  with a clear conscience.

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going,  And such an instrument I was to use.

Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses,  Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,  
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,  Which was not so before. There’s no such thing.  It is the bloody business which informs  
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world

Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse  The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates  Pale Hecate’s offerings, and withered murder,  Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,

Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,  With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design  Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,  Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear  Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,

And take the present horror from the time,  Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.  
real as this other dagger that I’m pulling out  now. (he draws a dagger) You’re leading me  toward the place I was going already, and I was  planning to use a weapon just like you. My  eyesight must either be the one sense that’s not  working, or else it’s the only one that’s working  right. I can still see you, and I see blood splotches  on your blade and handle that weren’t there  before. (to himself) There’s no dagger here. It’s  the murder I’m about to do that’s making me think  I see one. Now half the world is asleep and being  deceived by evil nightmares. Witches are offering  sacrifices to their goddess Hecate. Old man  murder, having been roused by the howls of his  wolf, walks silently to his destination, moving  like Tarquin, as quiet as a ghost. (speaking to the  ground) Hard ground, don’t listen to the direction  of my steps. I don’t want you to echo back where  I am and break the terrible stillness of this  moment, a silence that is so appropriate for what  I’m about to do. While I stay here talking, Duncan  lives. The more I talk, the more my courage  cools.

That which hath made them drunk hath made me  bold.  
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.  Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal  bellman,  
5 
Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it.  The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms  Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged  their possets,  
That death and nature do contend about them,  Whether they live or die.

Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,

And ’tis not done. Th' attempt and not the deed  Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;  
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made  me bold. The same liquor that quenched their  thirst has fired me up. Listen! Quiet! That was the owl that shrieked, with a scary “good night” like  the bells they ring before they execute people.  Macbeth must be killing the king right now. The  doors to Duncan’s chamber are open, and the  drunk servants make a mockery of their jobs by  snoring instead of protecting the king. I put so  many drugs in their drinks that you can’t tell if  they’re alive or dead.  
MACBETH 
(from offstage) Who’s there? What is it?  LADY MACBETH 
Oh no, I’m afraid the servants woke up, and the  murder didn’t happen. For us to attempt murder  and not succeed would ruin us. (She hears a

Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!  Macbeth does murder sleep”—the innocent sleep,  Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care,  The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath,  Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,  40 
Chief nourisher in life’s feast.  
LADY MACBETH 
 What do you mean?  
MACBETH 
Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house.  “Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor  Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.”  LADY MACBETH 
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,  You do unbend your noble strength to think  
45 
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,  And wash this filthy witness from your hand.  Why did you bring these daggers from the place?  They must lie there. Go carry them and smear  50 
The sleepy grooms with blood.  
MACBETH 
 I’ll go no more:  
I am afraid to think what I have done;  
Look on ’t again I dare not.  
LADY MACBETH 
 Infirm of purpose!  
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead  Are but as pictures. 'Tis the eye of childhood  55 
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,  
I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,  
For it must seem their guilt.  
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!  Macbeth is murdering sleep.” Innocent sleep.  Sleep that soothes away all our worries. Sleep  that puts each day to rest. Sleep that relieves the weary laborer and heals hurt minds. Sleep, the  main course in life’s feast, and the most  nourishing.  
LADY MACBETH 
What are you talking about?  
MACBETH 
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to  everyone in the house. “Macbeth has murdered  sleep, and therefore Macbeth will sleep no more.”  LADY MACBETH 
Who said that? Why, my worthy lord, you let  yourself become weak when you think about  things in this cowardly way. Go get some water  and wash this bloody evidence from your hands.  Why did you carry these daggers out of the  room? They have to stay there. Go take them  back and smear the sleeping guards with the  blood.  
MACBETH 
I can’t go back. I’m afraid even to think about  what I’ve done. I can’t stand to look at it again.  
LADY MACBETH 
Coward! Give me the daggers. Dead and  sleeping people can’t hurt you any more than  pictures can. Only children are afraid of scary  pictures. If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood. We must make it seem like  they’re guilty.

'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock. And  drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.  MACDUFF 
What three things does drink especially provoke?  PORTER 
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery,  sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes the  desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore,  much drink may be said to be an equivocator with  lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on,  and it takes him off; it persuades him, and  
disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand  to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.  
MACDUFF 
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.  
MACDUFF 
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re  having a hard time getting up now?  
PORTER 
That’s right sir, we were drinking until 3 A.M., and  drink, sir, makes a man do three things.  MACDUFF 
What three things does drink make a man do?  PORTER 
Drinking turns your nose red, it puts you to sleep, and it makes you urinate. Lust it turns on but also turns off. What I mean is, drinking stimulates  desire but hinders performance. Therefore, too  much drink is like a con artist when it comes to  your sex drive. It sets you up for a fall. It gets you  up but it keeps you from getting off. It persuades  you and discourages you. It gives you an erection  but doesn’t let you keep it, if you see what I’m  saying. It makes you dream about erotic  experiences, but then it leaves you asleep and  needing to pee.  
MACDUFF 
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.

PORTER

What’s wrong?  
MACBETH 
75 
You are, and do not know ’t.  
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood  Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.  MACDUFF 
Your royal father’s murdered.  
MALCOLM 
 Oh, by whom?  
LENNOX 
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.  80 
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.  So were their daggers, which unwiped we found  Upon their pillows. They stared, and were distracted.  No man’s life was to be trusted with them.  
MACBETH 
Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury,  
That I did kill them.  
85 
You are, but you don’t know it yet. The source  from which your royal blood comes has been  stopped.  
MACDUFF 
Your royal father is murdered.  
MALCOLM 
Who did it?  
LENNOX 
It seems that the guards who were supposed to  be protecting his chamber did it. Their hands and  faces were all covered with blood. So were their  daggers, which we found on their pillows,  unwiped. They stared at us in confusion. No  one’s life should have been entrusted to them.  MACBETH 
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill  them.

Wherefore did you so?

Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious,  Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.  
Th' expedition of my violent love

Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,  His silver skin laced with his golden blood,  And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there, the murderers, Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain,  That had a heart to love, and in that heart  Courage to make ’s love known?  
LADY MACBETH 
 Help me hence, ho!  
MACDUFF 
Look to the lady.  
MALCOLM 
(aside to DONALBAIN ) Why do we hold our  tongues,  
That most may claim this argument for ours?  
for Duncan caused me to act before I could think  rationally and tell myself to pause. There was  Duncan, his white skin all splattered with his  precious blood. The gashes where the knives  had cut him looked like wounds to nature itself.  Then right next to him I saw the murderers,  dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered  in gore. Who could have restrained himself, who  loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?  LADY MACBETH 
Help me out of here, quickly!  
MACDUFF 
Take care of the lady.  
MALCOLM 
(speaking so that only DONALBAIN can  hear)Why are we keeping quiet? The two of us  have the most to say in this matter.

And when we have our naked frailties hid,  That suffer in exposure, let us meet  
And question this most bloody piece of work,  To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.  In the great hand of God I stand, and thence  Against the undivulged pretense I fight  Of treasonous malice.

 Well contented.  
When we’re properly dressed for the cold, let’s  meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we  can figure anything out. Right now we’re shaken  up by fears and doubts. I’m putting myself in  God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight  against the secret plot that caused this  treasonous murder.

What will you do? Let’s not consort with them.  To show an unfelt sorrow is an office  
Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.  
DONALBAIN 
To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune  
Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are,  There’s daggers in men’s smiles. The near in blood, The nearer bloody.  
MALCOLM 
This murderous shaft that’s shot  
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way  Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse,  And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,  But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft  
Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left.  
MALCOLM 
What are you going to do? Let’s not stay here  with them. It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel  sorrow when he actually feels none. I’m going to  England.  
DONALBAIN 
I’ll go to Ireland. We’ll both be safer if we go  separate ways. Wherever we go, men will smile  at us while hiding daggers. Our closest relatives  are the ones most likely to murder us.  MALCOLM 
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the  best thing to do is avoid it entirely. With that in mind, let’s get on our horses. We’d better not  worry about saying polite good-byes; we should  just get away quickly. There’s good reason to  escape when there’s no mercy to be found  anymore.

Enter ROSS with an OLD MAN ROSS and an OLD MAN enter.  
OLD MAN 
Threescore and ten I can remember well,  
Within the volume of which time I have seen  Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night  Hath trifled former knowings.  
ROSS 
 Ha, good father,  
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act, 
5 
Threatens his bloody stage. By th' clock ’tis day,  And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.  Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame  That darkness does the face of Earth entomb  10 
When living light should kiss it?  
OLD MAN 
 'Tis unnatural,  
Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last,  A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place,  
Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.  ROSS 
And Duncan’s horses—a thing most strange and  15 
certain—  
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,  Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,  Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would  Make war with mankind.  
OLD MAN 
 'Tis said they eat each other.  
ROSS 
They did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes  20 
That looked upon ’t. Here comes the good Macduff.  
OLD MAN 
I can remember the past seventy years pretty  well, and in all that time I have seen dreadful  hours and strange things. But last night’s horrors  make everything that came before seem like a  joke.  
ROSS 
Ah yes, old man. You can see the skies. They  look like they’re upset about what mankind has  been doing, and they’re threatening the Earth  with storms. The clock says it’s daytime, but dark  night is strangling the sun. Is it because night is so strong, or because day is so weak, that  darkness covers the earth when it’s supposed to  be light?  
OLD MAN 
It’s unnatural, just like the murder that has been  committed. Last Tuesday a falcon was circling  high in the sky, and it was caught and killed by an ordinary owl that usually goes after mice.  ROSS 
And something else strange happened. Duncan’s  horses, which are beautiful and swift and the best  of their breed, suddenly turned wild and broke out  of their stalls. Refusing to be obedient as usual,  
they acted like they were at war with mankind.  
OLD MAN 
They say the horses ate each other.  
ROSS 
I saw it with my own eyes. It was an amazing  sight. Here comes the good Macduff.

 Alas, the day!

Can’t you see for yourself?

'Gainst nature still!  
Thriftless ambition, that will raven up

Thine own lives' means! Then ’tis most like  The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.  MACDUFF 
He is already named and gone to Scone  To be invested.  
ROSS 
Where is Duncan’s body?  
MACDUFF 
Carried to Colmekill,  
35 
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,  And guardian of their bones.  
ROSS 
 Will you to Scone?  
MACDUFF 
No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.  
ROSS 
Well, I will thither.  
MACDUFF 
They were paid to betray their master. Malcolm  and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, have run  away and fled, which makes them the prime  suspects.  
ROSS 
Everything about this is unnatural! What a stupid  ambition, causing a son to kill the father who  supports him. Then it looks like Macbeth will  become king.  
MACDUFF 
He has already been named king and has left for  Scone to be crowned.  
ROSS 
Where is Duncan’s body?  
MACDUFF 
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the  tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept  safe.

Are you going to Scone?

No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.

BANQUO 
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,  As the weird women promised, and I fear  Thou played’st most foully for ’t. Yet it was said  It should not stand in thy posterity,  
5 
But that myself should be the root and father  Of many kings. If there come truth from them—  As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine—  Why, by the verities on thee made good,  May they not be my oracles as well,  
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.  10 
BANQUO 
Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of  Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the  weird women promised you. And I suspect you  cheated to win these titles. But it was also  prophesied that the crown would not go to your  descendants, and that my sons and grandsons  would be kings instead. If the witches tell the  truth—which they did about you—maybe what  they said about me will come true too. But shhh!  I’ll shut up now.

I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now  until dinner. Unless my horse goes faster than  expected, I will be back an hour or two after  sunset.

Don’t miss our feast.  
BANQUO 
My lord, I won’t miss it.

We hear that the princes, those murderers, have  hidden in England and Ireland. They haven’t  confessed to cruelly murdering their own father,  and they’ve been making up strange lies to tell  their hosts. But we can talk more about that  tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that  concern us both. Hurry up and get to your horse.  Good-bye, until you return tonight.

To be thus is nothing,

But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo  Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature  
Reigns that which would be feared. 'Tis much he  dares,  
And to that dauntless temper of his mind  
55 
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor  To act in safety. There is none but he  
Whose being I do fear, and under him  
My genius is rebuked, as it is said  
Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters  
60 
When first they put the name of king upon me  And bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike,  They hailed him father to a line of kings.  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown  65 
And put a barren scepter in my grip,  
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,  No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so,  
For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind;  For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered;  70 
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace  
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel  
Given to the common enemy of man,  
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!  Rather than so, come fate into the list,  
And champion me to th' utterance. Who’s there?  
king. I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s  something noble about him that makes me fear  him. He’s willing to take risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act bravely  but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him.  Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just  as Mark Antony’s angel supposedly feared  Octavius Caesar. Banquo chided the witches  when they first called me king, asking them to tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they  named him the father to a line of kings. They  gave me a crown and a scepter that I can’t pass  on. Someone outside my family will take these  things away from me, since no son of mine will  take my place as king. If this is true, then I’ve  tortured my conscience and murdered the  gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons. I’ve ruined  my own peace for their benefit. I’ve handed over  my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of  watching that happen, I will challenge fate to  battle and fight to the death. Who’s there!

FIRST MURDERER 
It was, so please your highness.  
MACBETH 
 Well then, now  
Have you considered of my speeches? Know  That it was he, in the times past, which held you  So under fortune, which you thought had been  Our innocent self. This I made good to you  In our last conference, passed in probation with you,  How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the  instruments,  
Who wrought with them, and all things else that  might  
To half a soul and to a notion crazed  
Say, “Thus did Banquo.”  
FIRST MURDERER 
 You made it known to us.  
MACBETH 
I did so, and went further, which is now  
Our point of second meeting. Do you find  Your patience so predominant in your nature  That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled  To pray for this good man and for his issue,  Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave  And beggared yours forever?  
FIRST MURDERER 
 We are men, my liege.  
MACBETH 
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,  
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,  curs,  
Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept  All by the name of dogs. The valued file  Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,  The housekeeper, the hunter, every one  According to the gift which bounteous nature  Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive  Particular addition, from the bill  
That writes them all alike. And so of men.  Now, if you have a station in the file,  
Not i' th' worst rank of manhood, say ’t,  
And I will put that business in your bosoms,  Whose execution takes your enemy off,  Grapples you to the heart and love of us,  Who wear our health but sickly in his life,  Which in his death were perfect.  
FIRST MURDERER 
It was yesterday, your highness.  
MACBETH 
Well, did you think about what I said? You should  know that it was Banquo who made your lives  hell for so long, which you always thought was  my fault. But I was innocent. I showed you the  proof at our last meeting. I explained how you  were deceived, how you were thwarted, the  things that were used against you, who was  working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person  to say, “Banquo did it!”  
FIRST MURDERER 
You explained it all.  
MACBETH 
I did that and more, which brings me to the point  of this second meeting. Are you so patient and  forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook?  Are you so pious that you would pray for this  man and his children, a man who has pushed  you toward an early grave and put your family in  poverty forever?  
FIRST MURDERER 
We are men, my lord.  
MACBETH 
Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just  as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,  mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and  wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you list  the different kinds of dogs according to their  qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are  fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones  are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can  classify each dog according to the natural gifts  that separate it from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you occupy some place in the  list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell  me. Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a  plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you  closer to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick.  I’ll be healthy when he is dead.

SECOND MURDERER 
 I am one, my liege,  
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world  Have so incensed that I am reckless what  I do to spite the world.  
FIRST MURDERER 
And I another  
So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,  That I would set my life on any chance,  To mend it or be rid on ’t.  
MACBETH 
 Both of you  
Know Banquo was your enemy.  
BOTH MURDERERS 
 True, my lord.  
MACBETH 
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance  That every minute of his being thrusts  Against my near’st of life. And though I could  With barefaced power sweep him from my sight  And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,  For certain friends that are both his and mine,  Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall  Who I myself struck down. And thence it is,  That I to your assistance do make love,  Masking the business from the common eye  For sundry weighty reasons.  
SECOND MURDERER 
My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world,  and I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I  do.  
FIRST MURDERER 
I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and trouble  that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it would  either fix my life or end it once and for all.  
MACBETH 
You both know Banquo was your enemy.  
BOTH MURDERERS 
It’s true, my lord.  
MACBETH 
He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that  every minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart.  Since I’m king, I could simply use my power to  get rid of him. But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in common whom I need, so I have  to be able to moan and cry over his death in  public even though I’ll be the one who had him  killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I  have to hide my real plans from the public eye  for many important reasons.

I will advise you where to plant yourselves,  Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time,  The moment on ’t; for ’t must be done tonight,  And something from the palace; always thought  That I require a clearness. And with him—  To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—  Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,  Whose absence is no less material to me  Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate  Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.  I’ll come to you anon.

(interrupts him) I can see the determination in  your eyes. Within the next hour I’ll tell you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done  tonight, away from the palace. Always remember  that I must be free from suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo and his  son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting  rid of Fleance is as important to me as knocking  off Banquo. Each of you should make up your  own mind about whether you’re going to do this.  I’ll come to you soon.  
BOTH MURDERERS 
We have decided, my lord. We’re in.  
MACBETH 
I’ll call for you soon. Stay inside.

Is Banquo gone from court?  
SERVANT 
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.  LADY MACBETH 
Say to the king I would attend his leisure  For a few words.  
SERVANT

Madam, I will.  
LADY MACBETH 
Has Banquo left the court?  
SERVANT 
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight.  LADY MACBETH

happy, you’ve spent everything and gained  nothing. It’s better to be the person who gets  murdered than to be the killer and be tormented  with anxiety.  
Enter MACBETH MACBETH enters.  
10 How now, my lord! Why do you keep alone,  Of sorriest fancies your companions making,  Using those thoughts which should indeed have died  With them they think on? Things without all remedy  Should be without regard. What’s done is done.  
MACBETH 
What’s going on, my lord? Why are you keeping  to yourself, with only your sad thoughts to keep  you company? Those thoughts should have died  when you killed the men you’re thinking about. If  you can’t fix it, you shouldn’t give it a second  thought. What’s done is done.  
MACBETH

We have scorched the snake, not killed it.  She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice  Remains in danger of her former tooth.  
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds  suffer,  
20 
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep  In the affliction of these terrible dreams  
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,  Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,  Than on the torture of the mind to lie  
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.  
25 
After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.  
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,  Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing  
Can touch him further.  
We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will  heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be  threatened by its fangs once again. But the  universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth  crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and  spend my nights tossing and turning with these  nightmares I’ve been having. I’d rather be dead  than endure this endless mental torture and  harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men  and sent them to rest in peace so that we could  gain our own peace. Duncan lies in his grave,  through with life’s troubles, and he’s sleeping  well. We have already done the worst we can do  to him with our treason. After that, nothing can  hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion,  invasion, or anything else.

Come on, gentle my lord,  
30 
Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial  Among your guests tonight.  
MACBETH 
 So shall I, love,  
And so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance  Apply to Banquo; present him eminence,  
Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we  35 
Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,  And make our faces vizards to our hearts,  Disguising what they are.  
LADY MACBETH 
 You must leave this.  
MACBETH 
Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!  Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.  
LADY MACBETH 
40 
But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.  
MACBETH 
There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.  
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown  His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons  The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums  45 
Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.  
LADY MACBETH 
 What’s to be done?  
Come on, relax, dear. Put on a happy face and  look cheerful and agreeable for your guests  tonight.  
MACBETH 
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope  you’ll do the same. Give Banquo your special  attention. Talk to him and look at him in a way  
that will make him feel important. We’re in a  dangerous situation, where we have to flatter him  and hide our true feelings.  
LADY MACBETH 
You have to stop talking like this.  
MACBETH 
Argh! I feel like my mind is full of scorpions, my  dear wife. You know that Banquo and his son  Fleance are still alive.  
LADY MACBETH 
But they can’t live forever.  
MACBETH 
That’s comforting. They can be killed, it’s true. So  be cheerful. Before the bat flies through the  castle, and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done.  
LADY MACBETH 
What are you going to do?  
Act 3, Scene 2, Page 3  
MACBETH 
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,  Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,  Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day

The gentle  creatures of the day are falling asleep, while  night’s predators are waking up to look for their  prey. (to LADY MACBETH) You seem surprised  at my words, but don’t question me yet.

LADY MACBETH 
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in  my heart they are all welcome.  
MACBETH 
Enter FIRST MURDERER at the door The FIRST MURDERER appears at the door.  MACBETH 
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks. 10 
Both sides are even. Here I’ll sit i' th' midst.  Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure  The table round.  
(aside to FIRST MURDERER) There’s blood upon  thy face.  
FIRST MURDERER 
'Tis Banquo’s then.  
MACBETH 
15 
'Tis better thee without than he within.  
Is he dispatched?  
And they respond to you with their hearts as well.  The table is full on both sides. I will sit here in the  middle. Be free and happy. Soon we will toast  around the table.  
(approaching the door and speaking to  theMURDERER) There’s blood on your face.  FIRST MURDERER 
Then it must be Banquo’s.  
MACBETH 
I’d rather see his blood splattered on your face  than flowing through his veins. Did you finish him  off?  
Act 3, Scene 4, Page 2  
FIRST MURDERER 
My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.  MACBETH 
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats:  
Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.  
FIRST MURDERER 
My lord, his throat is cut. I did that to him.  MACBETH 
You are the best of the cutthroats. But whoever  did the same to Fleance must also be good. If

20 If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil. you cut both their throats, then you are the  absolute best.  
FIRST MURDERER 
Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.  
MACBETH 
Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,  Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,  As broad and general as the casing air.  
25 
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in  To saucy doubts and fears.—But Banquo’s safe?  FIRST MURDERER 
Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,  With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head,  The least a death to nature.  
MACBETH 
 Thanks for that.  
30 
There the grown serpent lies. The worm that’s fled  Hath nature that in time will venom breed;  No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow  We’ll hear ourselves again.  
FIRST MURDERER 
Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.  
MACBETH 
Now I’m scared again. Otherwise I would have  been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as  firm as a rock, as free as the air itself. But now  I’m all tangled up with doubts and fears. But  
Banquo’s been taken care of?  
FIRST MURDERER 
Yes, my good lord. He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which  would have been enough to kill him.  
MACBETH 
Thanks for that. The adult snake lies in the ditch. The young snake that escaped will in time  become poisonous and threatening, but for now  he has no fangs. Get out of here. I’ll talk to you  again tomorrow.  
LADY MACBETH 
 My royal lord,  
Exit FIRST MURDERER The FIRST MURDERER exits.  LADY MACBETH 
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests.  
You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold  35 
That is not often vouched, while ’tis a-making,  'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;  Meeting were bare without it.  
If you don’t make your guests know they’re  welcome, they’ll feel like they’re paying for their meal. When you just want to eat, it’s better to do  that at home. When you’re eating out with people,  you need to have a little more ceremony.  Otherwise dinner parties would be boring.  
Act 3, Scene 4, Page 3

 Sweet remembrancer!  Now, good digestion wait on appetite,

 His absence, sir,  
Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your  highness  
To grace us with your royal company?  
good appetite, and good health requires both of  those, here’s to good appetites, good digestion,  and good health!  
LENNOX 
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?  The GHOST OF BANQUO enters and sits  inMACBETH’s place.  
MACBETH 
We would have all the nobility of Scotland  gathered under one roof, if only Banquo were  here. I hope it turns out that he’s late out of  rudeness, and not because something bad has  happened to him.  
ROSS 
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.  If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company?

Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well.  LADY MACBETH 
Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus  
And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.  The fit is momentary; upon a thought  
He will again be well. If much you note him,  60 
You shall offend him and extend his passion.  Feed and regard him not. (aside to MACBETH) Are  you a man?  
MACBETH 
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that  Which might appall the devil.  
LADY MACBETH 
 O proper stuff!  
This is the very painting of your fear.  
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said  
65 
Led you to Duncan. Oh, these flaws and starts,  Impostors to true fear, would well become  A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,  
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!  Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,  
70 
You look but on a stool.  
MACBETH 
Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?  Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.  If charnel houses and our graves must send  75 
Those that we bury back, our monuments  Shall be the maws of kites.  
Gentlemen, stand up. His highness is not well.  LADY MACBETH 
Sit down, worthy friends. My husband is often like  this, and he has been since he was a child.  Please stay seated. This is just a brief fit. In a  moment he’ll be well again. If you pay too much  attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that  will make his convulsions go on longer. Eat your  dinner and pay no attention to him. (speaking so  that only MACBETH can hear) Are you a man?  MACBETH 
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at  something that would frighten the devil.  LADY MACBETH 
Oh, that’s nonsense! This is just another one of  the hallucinations you always get when you’re  afraid. This is like that floating dagger you said  was leading you toward Duncan. These outbursts  of yours don’t even look like real fear. They’re  more like how you would act if you were a woman  telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her  grandmother. Shame on you! Why are you  making these faces? When the vision passes,  you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.  MACBETH 
Please, just look over there. Look! Look! See! (to  the GHOST) What do you have to say? What do I  care? If you can nod, then speak too. If the dead  are going to return from their graves, then there’s nothing to stop the birds from eating the bodies.  So there’s no point in our burying people.

I am as brave as any other man. Come at me in  the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran. Take any  shape other than the one you have now and I will  never tremble in fear. Or come back to life again  and challenge me to a duel in some deserted  place.

It will have blood, they say. Blood will have blood.  Stones have been known to move, and trees to  speak.  
Augurs and understood relations have  
By magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth  The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?  LADY MACBETH 
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.  
MACBETH 
There’s an old saying: the dead will have their  revenge. Gravestones have been known to  move, and trees to speak, to bring guilty men to  justice. The craftiest murderers have been  exposed by the mystical signs made by crows  and magpies. How late at night is it?  LADY MACBETH 
It’s almost morning. You can’t tell whether it’s  day or night.

MACBETH 
How say’st thou that Macduff denies his person  At our great bidding?  
LADY MACBETH 
 Did you send to him, sir?  
MACBETH 
I hear it by the way; but I will send.  
There’s not a one of them but in his house  I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow—  And betimes I will—to the weird sisters.  More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know,  By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,  All causes shall give way. I am in blood  Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,  Returning were as tedious as go o'er.  
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,  Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.  
MACBETH 
What do you think about the fact that Macduff  refuses to come to me when I command him?  LADY MACBETH 
Did you send for him, sir?  
MACBETH 
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for  him. In every one of the lords' households I have  a servant paid to spy for me. Tomorrow, while it’s  
still early, I will go see the witches. They will tell  me more, because I’m determined to know the  worst about what’s going to happen. My own  safety is the only important thing now. I have  walked so far into this river of blood that even if I  stopped now, it would be as hard to go back to  being good as it is to keep killing people. I have  some schemes in my head that I’m planning to  put into action. I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.

Why, how now, Hecate! You look angerly.  HECATE 
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?  Saucy and overbold, how did you dare  To trade and traffic with Macbeth  In riddles and affairs of death,  
And I, the mistress of your charms,  The close contriver of all harms,  Was never called to bear my part,  Or show the glory of our art?  
And, which is worse, all you have done  Hath been but for a wayward son,  Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,  Loves for his own ends, not for you.  But make amends now. Get you gone,  And at the pit of Acheron  
Meet me i' th' morning. Thither he  Will come to know his destiny.  
Your vessels and your spells provide,  
FIRST WITCH 
What’s wrong, Hecate? You look angry.  HECATE 
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you  disobedient hags? How dare you give Macbeth  riddles and prophecies about his future without  telling me? I am your boss and the source of your  powers. I am the one who secretly decides what  evil things happen, but you never called me to  join in and show off my own powers. And what’s  worse, you’ve done all this for a man who  behaves like a spoiled brat, angry and hateful.  Like all spoiled sons, he chases after what he  wants and doesn’t care about you. But you can  make it up to me. Go away now and in the  morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell.  Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny. You  bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms,  and everything else. I’m about to fly away. I’ll  spend tonight working to make something horrible

LENNOX 
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,  Which can interpret farther. Only I say  
Things have been strangely borne. The gracious  Duncan  
5 
Was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.  And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late,  Whom, you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed,  For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.  Who cannot want the thought how monstrous  10 
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain  
To kill their gracious father? Damnèd fact!  How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight  In pious rage the two delinquents tear  
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? 15 
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,  For ’twould have angered any heart alive  
To hear the men deny ’t. So that, I say,  
He has borne all things well. And I do think  That had he Duncan’s sons under his key—  20 
As, an’t please heaven, he shall not—they should  find  
What ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.  But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he  
LENNOX 
What I’ve already said shows you we think alike,  so you can draw your own conclusions. All I’m  saying is that strange things have been going on.  Macbeth pitied Duncan—after Duncan was dead.  And Banquo went out walking too late at night. If  you like, we can say that Fleance must have  killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the  crime. Clearly, men should not go out walking too  late! And who can help thinking how monstrous it  was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their  gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it  saddened Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill  those two servants right away, while they were  still drunk and asleep? That was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear  those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth has handled things well. If he had  Duncan’s sons in prison—which I hope won’t  happen—they would find out how awful the  punishment is for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough of that. I hear that  Macduff is out of favor with the king because he 
No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -43-   Original Text Modern Text  
failed  
His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear  Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell  Where he bestows himself?  
LORD 
 The son of Duncan—  
25 
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth—  Lives in the English court and is received  Of the most pious Edward with such grace  That the malevolence of fortune nothing  Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff  30 
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid  To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,  That by the help of these—with Him above  To ratify the work—we may again  
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,  35 
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,  Do faithful homage and receive free honors.  All which we pine for now. And this report  Hath so exasperated the king that he  
Prepares for some attempt of war.  
speaks his mind too plainly, and because he  failed to show up at Macbeth’s feast. Can you tell  me where he’s hiding himself?  
LORD 
Duncan’s son Malcolm, whose birthright and  throne Macbeth has stolen, lives in the English  court. There, the saintly King Edward treats  Malcolm so well that despite Malcolm’s  misfortunes, he’s not deprived of respect.  Macduff went there to ask King Edward for help.  He wants Edward to help him form an alliance  with the people of Northumberland and their lord,  Siward. Macduff hopes that with their help—and  with the help of God above—he may once again  put food on our tables, bring peace back to our  nights, free our feasts and banquets from violent  murders, allow us to pay proper homage to our  king, and receive honors freely. Those are the  things we pine for now. Macbeth has heard this  news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for  war.

Sent he to Macduff?  
LORD 
He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”  The cloudy messenger turns me his back,  And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time  That clogs me with this answer.”  
LENNOX 
 And that well might  
Advise him to a caution, t' hold what distance  
45 
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel  Fly to the court of England and unfold  
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing  May soon return to this our suffering country  50 
Under a hand accursed!  
LORD 
I’ll send my prayers with him.  
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland?  LORD 
He did, but Macduff told the messenger, “No  way.” The messenger scowled and rudely turned  his back on Macduff, as if to say, “You’ll regret  the day you gave me this answer.”  
LENNOX 
That might well keep Macduff away from  Scotland. Some holy angel should go to the court  of England and give Macduff a message. He  should return quickly to free our country, which is suffering under a tyrant!

thoughts with actions right now. I’ll raid Macduff’s  castle, seize the town of Fife, and kill his wife, his  children, and anyone else unfortunate enough to  
stand in line for his inheritance. No more foolish  talk. I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose. But no more spooky visions!—Where  are the messengers? Come, bring me to them.

Act 4, Scene 2  
Enter LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS enter.  
LADY MACDUFF 
What had he done to make him fly the land?  ROSS 
You must have patience, madam.  
LADY MACDUFF 
 He had none.  
His flight was madness. When our actions do not,  Our fears do make us traitors.  
ROSS 
 You know not  
5  
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Wisdom! To leave his wife, to leave his babes,  His mansion and his titles in a place  
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;  He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren,  10 
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,  
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.  All is the fear and nothing is the love,  
As little is the wisdom, where the flight  
So runs against all reason.  
ROSS 
 My dearest coz,  
15 
I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,  He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows  The fits o' th' season. I dare not speak much further;  But cruel are the times when we are traitors  And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor  20 
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,  But float upon a wild and violent sea  
Each way and none. I take my leave of you.  Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.  
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward  25 
To what they were before.—My pretty cousin,  Blessing upon you.  
LADY MACDUFF 
What did he do that made him flee this land?  ROSS 
You have to be patient, madam.  
LADY MACDUFF 
He had no patience. He was crazy to run away.  Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look  like one if you run away.  
ROSS 
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear  that made him flee.  
LADY MACDUFF 
How could it be wisdom! To leave his wife, his  children, his house, and his titles in a place so  unsafe that he himself flees it! He doesn’t love us.  He lacks the natural instinct to protect his family.  Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will  fight against the owl when it threatens her young  ones in the nest. His running away has everything  to do with fear and nothing to do with love. And  since it’s so unreasonable for him to run away, it  has nothing to do with wisdom either.  
ROSS 
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together. As for your husband, he is noble, wise,  and judicious, and he understands what the times  require. It’s not safe for me to say much more  than this, but times are bad when people get  denounced as traitors and don’t even know why.  In times like these, we believe frightening rumors  but we don’t even know what we’re afraid of. It’s  like being tossed around on the ocean in every  direction, and finally getting nowhere. I’ll say  good-bye now. It won’t be long before I’m back.  When things are at their worst they have to stop,  or else improve to the way things were before. My

Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless.  ROSS 
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer  It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.  30 
I take my leave at once.  
LADY MACDUFF 
 Sirrah, your father’s dead.  
And what will you do now? How will you live?  SON 
As birds do, Mother.  
LADY MACDUFF 
What, with worms and flies?  
SON 
With what I get, I mean, and so do they.  LADY MACDUFF 
Poor bird! Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,  
35 
The pitfall nor the gin.  
SON 
LADY MACDUFF 
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.  
ROSS 
I have to go. If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you  and disgrace myself by crying. I’m leaving now.  
Exit ROSS exits.  LADY MACDUFF 
Young man, your father’s dead. What are you  going to do now? How are you going to live?  SON 
I will live the way birds do, Mother.  
LADY MACDUFF 
What? Are you going to start eating worms and  flies?  
SON 
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.  LADY MACDUFF 
You’d be a pitiful bird. You wouldn’t know enough  to be afraid of traps.  
SON 
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.  My father is not dead, for all your saying.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?  
SON 
40 
Nay, how will you do for a husband?  
LADY MACDUFF 
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.  
Why should I be afraid of them, Mother? If I’m a  pitiful bird, like you say, hunters won’t want me.  No matter what you say, my father is not dead.  LADY MACDUFF 
Yes, he is dead. What are you going to do for a  father?  
SON 
Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a  husband?  
LADY MACDUFF 
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market.  
Act 4, Scene 2, Page 3  
SON 
Then you’ll buy 'em to sell again.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet, i' faith,  With wit enough for thee.  
SON 
SON 
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again.  LADY MACDUFF 
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart  anyway.  
SON 
45 
Was my father a traitor, Mother?  LADY MACDUFF 
Ay, that he was.  
SON 
What is a traitor?  
Was my father a traitor, Mother?  LADY MACDUFF 
Yes, he was.  
SON 
What is a traitor?  
LADY MACDUFF LADY MACDUFF
No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -51-   Original Text Modern Text  
Why, one that swears and lies. Someone who makes a promise and breaks it.  
SON 
And be all traitors that do so?  
LADY MACDUFF 
50 
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be  hanged.  
SON 
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?  
LADY MACDUFF 
Every one.  
SON 
Who must hang them?  
LADY MACDUFF 
Why, the honest men.  
SON 
Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are  
55 
liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men  and hang up them.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou  do for a father?  
SON 
If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would not,  it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new  father.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!  
SON 
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor?  LADY MACDUFF 
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be  hanged.  
SON 
And should everyone who makes promises and  breaks them be hanged?  
LADY MACDUFF 
Everyone.  
SON 
Who should hang them?  
LADY MACDUFF 
The honest men.  
SON 
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars  in the world to beat up the honest men and hang  them.  
LADY MACDUFF 
(laughing) Heaven help you for saying that,  boy!(sad again) But what will you do without a  father?  
SON 
If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him. If you  aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have  a new father.  
LADY MACDUFF 
Silly babbler, how you talk!

Enter a MESSENGER A MESSENGER enters.  
MESSENGER 
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,  Though in your state of honor I am perfect.  
60 
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.  If you will take a homely man’s advice,  
Be not found here. Hence with your little ones.  To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;  To do worse to you were fell cruelty,  
65 
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer.  
MESSENGER 
Bless you, fair lady! You don’t know me, but I  know you’re an important person. I’m afraid  something dangerous is coming toward you. If  you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here  when it arrives. Go away and take your children. I  feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm. And  harm is getting close! Heaven keep you safe!  
70 
LADY MACDUFF 
Whither should I fly?  
I have done no harm. But I remember now  I am in this earthly world, where to do harm  Is often laudable, to do good sometime  Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,  Do I put up that womanly defense,  To say I have done no harm?  
Exit The MESSENGER exits.  LADY MACDUFF 
Where should I go? I haven’t done anything  wrong. But I have to remember that I’m here on  Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and  doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous  mistake. So then why should I offer this  
womanish defense that I’m innocent?

MALCOLM 
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there  Weep our sad bosoms empty.  
MACDUFF 
 Let us rather  
Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,  Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn  New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows  
5 
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds  As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out  
Like syllable of dolor.  
MALCOLM 
 What I believe I’ll wail;  
What know believe, and what I can redress,  10 
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.  
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.  This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,  Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.  He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but  15 
something  
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom  To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb  
T' appease an angry god.  
MACDUFF 
I am not treacherous.  
MALCOLM 
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can  sit down alone and cry our hearts out.  MACDUFF 
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords  and defend our fallen homeland like honorable  men. Each day new widows howl, new orphans  
cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face,  until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.  
MALCOLM 
I will avenge whatever I believe is wrong. And I’ll believe whatever I’m sure is true. And I’ll put right  whatever I can when the time comes. What you  just said may perhaps be true. This tyrant, whose  mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was  once considered an honest man. You were one of  his favorites. He hasn’t done anything to harm  you yet. I’m inexperienced, but maybe you’re  planning to win Macbeth’s favor by betraying me  to him. It would be smart to offer someone poor  and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to  satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.  
MACDUFF 
I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM 
But Macbeth is.  
20 
A good and virtuous nature may recoil  
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.  That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.  Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell. Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,  25 
Yet grace must still look so.  
MALCOLM 
But Macbeth is. Even someone with a good and  virtuous nature might give way to a royal  command. But I beg your pardon. My fears can’t  actually make you evil. Angels are still bright even  though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from  heaven. Even though everything evil wants to  look good, good still has to look good too.  
Act 4, Scene 3, Page 2  
MACDUFF 
 I have lost my hopes.  
MALCOLM 
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.  Why in that rawness left you wife and child,  Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking? I pray you,  
MACDUFF 
I have lost my hope of convincing you to fight  against Macbeth.  
MALCOLM 
Maybe you lost your hopes about me where I  found my doubts about you. Why did you leave  your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious  things in your life, those strong bonds of love?  
30 
Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,  But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,  Whatever I shall think.  
MACDUFF 
 Bleed, bleed, poor country!  
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,  
For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy  35 
wrongs;  
The title is affeered.—Fare thee well, lord.  I would not be the villain that thou think’st  For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,  And the rich East to boot.  
MALCOLM 
 Be not offended.  
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.  
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.  
40 
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash  Is added to her wounds. I think withal  
There would be hands uplifted in my right;  And here from gracious England have I offer  Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,  
45 
When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,  Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country  Shall have more vices than it had before,  More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,  By him that shall succeed.  
50 
MACDUFF 
 What should he be?  
How could you leave them behind? But I beg you,  don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against  you. You must understand that I want to protect  myself. You may really be honest, no matter what  I think.  
MACDUFF 
Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyrant, go  ahead and build yourself up, because good  people are afraid to stand up to you. Enjoy  
everything you stole, because your title is safe!  Farewell, lord. I wouldn’t be the villain you think I  am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s  kingdom and the riches of the East too.  
MALCOLM 
Don’t be offended. I don’t completely distrust you. I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s  oppression. Our country weeps, it bleeds, and  each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds. I  also think there would be many people willing to  fight for me. The English have promised me  thousands of troops. But even so, when I have  Macbeth’s head under my foot, or stuck on the  end of my sword, then my poor country will be  plagued by worse evil than it was before. It will  suffer worse and in more ways than ever under  the reign of the king who follows Macbeth.  
MACDUFF 
Who are you talking about?

That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth  Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state  55 
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared  
With my confineless harms.  
MACDUFF 
 Not in the legions  
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned  In evils to top Macbeth.  
MALCOLM 
 I grant him bloody,  
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,

Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin  That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none,  In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,  Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up  The cistern of my lust, and my desire

All continent impediments would o'erbear  That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth  
Than such an one to reign.  
MACDUFF 
 Boundless intemperance  
In nature is a tyranny. It hath been

To take upon you what is yours. You may  Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty  And yet seem cold; the time you may so hoodwink.  We have willing dames enough. There cannot be  That vulture in you to devour so many

vices that when people see all of them exposed,  evil Macbeth will seem as pure as snow in  comparison, and poor Scotland will call him a  sweet lamb when they compare him to me and  my infinite evils.  
MACDUFF 
Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than  Macbeth.  
MALCOLM 
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy,  lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name. But there is no end,  absolutely none, to my sexual desires. Your  wives, your daughters, your old women, and your  young maids together could not satisfy my lust.  My desire would overpower all restraints and  anyone who stood in my way. It would be better  for Macbeth to rule than someone like me.  
MACDUFF 
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind  of tyranny. It has caused the downfall of many  kings. But don’t be afraid to take the crown that  belongs to you. You can find a way to satisfy your  desires in secret, while still appearing virtuous.  You can deceive everyone. There are more than  enough willing women around. Your lust can’t  possibly be so strong that you’d use up all the  women willing to give themselves to the king  once they find out he wants them.  
Act 4, Scene 3, Page 4  
MALCOLM

MACDUFF 
 This avarice  
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root  Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been  The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;  Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,  Of your mere own. All these are portable,  With other graces weighed.  
nobles' lands, taking jewels from one guy and  houses from another. The more I had, the  greedier I would grow, until I’d invent false  quarrels with my good and loyal subjects,  destroying them so I could get my hands on their  wealth.  
MACDUFF 
The greed you’re talking about is worse than lust  because you won’t outgrow it. Greed has been  the downfall of many kings. But don’t be afraid.  Scotland has enough treasures to satisfy you out  of your own royal coffers. These bad qualities  are bearable when balanced against your good  sides.

If such a one be fit to govern, speak.  I am as I have spoken.  
But I don’t have any good sides. I don’t have a  trace of the qualities a king needs, such as  justice, truth, moderation, stability, generosity,  perseverance, mercy, humility, devotion,  patience, courage, and bravery. Instead, I  overflow with every variation of all the different  vices. No, if I had power I would take world  peace and throw it down to hell.

No, not to live.—O nation miserable,  
With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,  When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,  Since that the truest issue of thy throne  By his own interdiction stands accursed,  And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal father  Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,  Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,  Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!  These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself  
Have banished me from Scotland.—O my breast,  Thy hope ends here!

 Macduff, this noble passion,  Child of integrity, hath from my soul  
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts  To thy good truth and honor.

But God above  Deal between thee and me, for even now  I put myself to thy direction and  
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure  The taints and blames I laid upon myself,  For strangers to my nature. I am yet  
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,  Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,  At no time broke my faith, would not betray  The devil to his fellow, and delight  
No less in truth than life. My first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly,  
Is thine and my poor country’s to command.

The man who has a legal right to the  throne is, by his own admission, a cursed man  and a disgrace to the royal family.—Your royal  father Duncan was a virtuous king. Your mother  spent more time on her knees in prayer than she  did standing up, and she lived a life of absolute  piety. Good-bye. The evils you have described  inside yourself have driven me out of Scotland  forever. Oh my heart, your hope is dead!  
MALCOLM 
Macduff, this passionate outburst, which proves  your integrity, has removed my doubts about you  and made me realize that you really are  trustworthy and honorable. That devil Macbeth  has tried many times to trick me and lure me into  his power, and prudence prevents me from  believing people too quickly. But with God as my  witness, I will let myself be guided by you, and I  take back my confession. I take back all the bad  things I said about myself, because none of  those flaws are really part of my character. I’m  still a virgin. I have never told a lie. I barely care  about what I already own, let alone feel jealous  of another’s possessions. I have never broken a  promise. I wouldn’t betray the devil himself. I love  truth as much as I love life. The lies I told about my character are actually the first false words I  have ever spoken. The person who I really am is  ready to serve you and our poor country.

Well, we’ll speak more soon. (to the DOCTOR)Is  King Edward coming out?

Yes, sir. A crowd of sick people is waiting for him to heal them. Their illness confounds the most  advanced techniques of modern medicine, but  when he touches them, they heal immediately  because of the power granted to him by heaven.  MALCOLM

A most miraculous work in this good king,  Which often since my here-remain in England  I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,  Himself best knows, but strangely visited people,  All swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,  The mere despair of surgery, he cures,  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,  Put on with holy prayers. And, ’tis spoken,  
miracle that I have seen him perform many times  during my stay in England. How he receives  these gifts from heaven, only he can say. But he  cures people with strange conditions—all  swollen, plagued by ulcers, and pitiful to look at, patients who are beyond the help of surgery—by  placing a gold coin around their necks and  saying holy prayers over them.  
Act 4, Scene 3, Page 7  
To the succeeding royalty he leaves  
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,  He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,  
They say that he bequeaths this ability to heal to  his royal descendants. Along with this strange  power, he also has the gift of prophecy and

 See, who comes here?  MALCOLM 
My countryman, but yet I know him not.

My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM 
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I  
don’t recognize him.

MALCOLM 
I know him now.—Good God, betimes remove  The means that makes us strangers!  
ROSS 
 Sir, amen.  
MACDUFF 
Stands Scotland where it did?  
ROSS 
 Alas, poor country!  
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot  
Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;  Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the  air  
Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems  A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell  Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps,  
Dying or ere they sicken.  
MACDUFF 
 Oh, relation  
Too nice and yet too true!  
MALCOLM 
I recognize him now. May God alter the  circumstances that keep us apart!  
ROSS 
Hello, sir.  
MACDUFF 
Is Scotland the same as when I left it?  ROSS 
Alas, our poor country! It’s too frightened to look at itself. Scotland is no longer the land where we  were born; it’s the land where we’ll die. Where no  one ever smiles except for the fool who knows  nothing. Where sighs, groans, and shrieks rip  through the air but no one notices. Where violent  sorrow is a common emotion. When the funeral  bells ring, people no longer ask who died. Good  men die before the flowers in their caps wilt.  They die before they even fall sick.  
MACDUFF 
Oh, your report is too poetic, but it sounds so  true!

 What’s the newest grief?  
ROSS 
That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker.  Each minute teems a new one.

Why, well.  
MACDUFF 
 And all my children?

 Well too.

No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.  MACDUFF

When I came hither to transport the tidings,  Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor  Of many worthy fellows that were out;  Which was to my belief witnessed the rather  For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.  Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland

Don’t be stingy with your words. What’s the  news?  
ROSS 
While I was coming here to tell you my sad  news, I heard rumors that many good men are  arming themselves to rebel against Macbeth.  When I saw Macbeth’s army on the move, I knew  the rumors must be true. Now is the time when  we need your help. Your presence in Scotland

MALCOLM 
Let them be comforted—I’m returning to  Scotland. Gracious King Edward has sent us  noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers. There is  no soldier more experienced or successful than  Siward in the entire Christian world.

MACDUFF 
 What concern they?  
The general cause, or is it a fee-grief  
Due to some single breast?  
ROSS 
 No mind that’s honest  
But in it shares some woe, though the main part  Pertains to you alone.  
MACDUFF 
If it be mine,  
Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.  ROSS 
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,  Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound  That ever yet they heard.  
MACDUFF 
 Hum! I guess at it.  
ROSS 
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes  Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner,  Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer  To add the death of you.  
MALCOLM 
 Merciful heaven!  
What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.  Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak  Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.  MACDUFF

news of my own. But I have some news that  should be howled in a barren desert where  nobody can hear it.  
MACDUFF 
What is this news about? Does it affect all of us?  Or just one of us?  
ROSS 
No decent man can keep from sharing in the  sorrow, but my news affects you alone.  
MACDUFF 
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me. Let me have  it now.  
ROSS 
I hope you won’t hate me forever after I say  these things, because I will soon fill your ears  with the most dreadful news you have ever  heard.  
MACDUFF 
I think I can guess what you’re about to say.  ROSS 
Your castle was attacked. Your wife and children  were savagely slaughtered. If I told you how they  were killed, it would cause you so much pain that  it would kill you too, and add your body to the pile  
of murdered corpses.  
MALCOLM 
Merciful heaven! (to MACDUFF) Come on, man,  don’t keep your grief hidden. Put your sorrow into  words. The grief you keep inside you will whisper  in your heart until it breaks.  
MACDUFF 
They killed my children too?  
ROSS 
They killed your wife, your children, your  servants, anyone they could find.

And I must be from thence!  
My wife killed too?  
ROSS 
I have said.  
MALCOLM 
Be comforted.  
Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge,  To cure this deadly grief.  
MACDUFF 
He has no children. All my pretty ones?  Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?  
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam  At one fell swoop?  
MALCOLM 
Dispute it like a man.  
MACDUFF 
I shall do so,  
But I must also feel it as a man.  
I cannot but remember such things were  That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,  And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,  They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,  Not for their own demerits, but for mine,  Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.  MALCOLM 
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief  Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart, enrage it.  
MACDUFF 
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes  And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,  Cut short all intermission. Front to front  
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.  Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,  Heaven forgive him too.  
MACDUFF 
And I had to be away! My wife was killed too?  
ROSS 
I said she was.  
MALCOLM 
Take comfort. Let’s cure this awful grief by taking revenge on Macbeth.  
MACDUFF 
He doesn’t have children. All my pretty little  children? Did you say all? Oh, that bird from hell! All of them? What, all my children and their  mother dead in one fell swoop?  
MALCOLM 
Fight it like a man.  
MACDUFF 
I will. But I also have to feel it like a man. I can’t  help remembering the things that were most  precious to me. Did heaven watch the slaughter  and not send down any help? Sinful Macduff,  they were killed because of you! As wicked as I  am, they were slaughtered because of me, not  because of anything they did. May God give their  souls rest.  
MALCOLM 
Let this anger sharpen your sword. Transform  your grief into anger. Don’t block the feelings in  your heart; let them loose as rage.  
MACDUFF 
I could go on weeping like a woman and  bragging about how I will avenge them! But  gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting. Bring me  face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland.  Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he  escapes, may heaven forgive him as well!

DOCTOR 
Enter a DOCTOR of physic and a waiting GENTLEWOMAN 
DOCTOR 
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her  rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her,  unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to  bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.  DOCTOR 
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the  benefit of sleep, and do the line>effects of watching.  In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have  you heard her say?  
GENTLEWOMAN 
That, sir, which I will not report after her.  
DOCTOR 
You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should.  GENTLEWOMAN 
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to  confirm my speech.  
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I  haven’t seen any evidence of what you were  talking about. When was the last time you saw  her sleepwalking?  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise  from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her  closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it,  read it, seal it up, and then return to bed,  remaining asleep the entire time.  
DOCTOR 
It’s unnatural to be asleep and act as if you’re  awake. When she is like this, besides walking  and performing various activities, have you heard  her say anything?  
GENTLEWOMAN 
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to  you.  
DOCTOR 
You can tell me. You really should.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else,  because there was no one else to witness her  speech.  
Enter LADY MACBETH with a taper LADY MACBETH enters, holding a candle.  
Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise; and,  upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her, stand close.  
DOCTOR

How came she by that light?  
Look, here she comes! This is exactly how she  always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep.  Watch her. Keep hidden.  
DOCTOR 
How did she get that candle?  
Act 5, Scene 1, Page 2  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Why, it stood by her. She has light by her continually.  'Tis her command.  
DOCTOR 
You see her eyes are open.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Ay, but their sense is shut.  
DOCTOR 
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her  hands.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
GENTLEWOMAN 
It stands by her bedside. She always has to have  a light next to her. Those are her orders.  DOCTOR 
You see, her eyes are open.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Yes, but they don’t see anything.  
DOCTOR 
What’s she doing now? Look how she rubs her  hands.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
20 
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus  washing her hands. I have known her continue in this  a quarter of an hour.  
She often does that. She looks like she’s washing  her hands. I’ve seen her do that before for as  long as fifteen minutes.

Yet here’s a spot. There’s still a spot here.  
DOCTOR 
Hark! She speaks. I will set down what comes from  her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.  LADY MACBETH 
25 
Out, damned spot! Out, I say!—One, two. Why,  then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord,  fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who  knows it, when none can call our power to  account?—Yet who would have thought the old man  to have had so much blood in him.  
DOCTOR 
Do you mark that?  
LADY MACBETH 
The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?— 
30 
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o'  that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this  starting.  
DOCTOR 
Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.  
DOCTOR 
Listen! She’s talking. I’ll write down what she  says, so I’ll remember it better.  
LADY MACBETH 
(rubbing her hands) Come out, damned spot!  Out, I command you! One, two. OK, it’s time to do  it now.—Hell is murky!—Nonsense, my lord,  nonsense! You are a soldier, and yet you are  afraid? Why should we be scared, when no one  can lay the guilt upon us?—But who would have  thought the old man would have had so much  blood in him?  
DOCTOR 
Did you hear that?  
LADY MACBETH 
The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she  now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No  more of that, my lord, no more of that. You’ll ruin everything by acting startled like this.  
DOCTOR 
Now look what you’ve done. You’ve heard  something you shouldn’t have.  
Act 5, Scene 1, Page 3  
GENTLEWOMAN 
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of  that. Heaven knows what she has known.  
LADY MACBETH 
Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of  Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, Oh, Oh!  
DOCTOR 
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the  dignity of the whole body.  
DOCTOR 
Well, well, well.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
Pray God it be, sir.  
DOCTOR 
GENTLEWOMAN 
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m  sure of that. Heaven knows what secrets she’s  keeping.  
LADY MACBETH 
I still have the smell of blood on my hand. All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand  smell better. Oh, oh, oh!  
DOCTOR 
What a heavy sigh! Her heart is carrying a heavy  weight.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made  me queen.  
DOCTOR 
Well, well, well.  
GENTLEWOMAN 
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!  
DOCTOR 
40 
This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have  known those which have walked in their sleep who  have died holily in their beds.  
LADY MACBETH 
Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Look not  so pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he  cannot come out on ’s grave.  
This disease is beyond my medical skills. But I  have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t  guilty of anything.

MENTEITH 
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.  
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes  Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm

ANGUS

Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.  CAITHNESS 
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?  
LENNOX 
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file  
Of all the gentry. There is Siward’s son,  
And many unrough youths that even now  
10 
Protest their first of manhood.  
MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX,  and soldiers enter with a drummer and flag.  
MENTEITH 
The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his  uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. They burn  for revenge. The wrongs they have suffered  would make dead men rise up and fight.  
ANGUS 
We’ll meet them near Birnam Wood. They are  coming that way.  
CAITHNESS 
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his  brother?  
LENNOX 
He is definitely not there, sir. I have a list of all the  important men. Siward’s son is there, as well as  many boys too young to have beards who will  become men by joining in this battle.

MENTEITH 
 What does the tyrant?  
CAITHNESS 
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.  
Some say he’s mad, others that lesser hate him  Do call it valiant fury. But, for certain,  
15 
He cannot buckle his distempered cause  Within the belt of rule.  
ANGUS 
 Now does he feel  
His secret murders sticking on his hands.  Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.  Those he commands move only in command,  20 
Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title  Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe  Upon a dwarfish thief.  
MENTEITH 
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?  
CAITHNESS 
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses. Some say he’s insane. Those who hate  him less call it brave anger. One thing is certain: he’s out of control.  
ANGUS 
Now Macbeth feels the blood of his murdered  enemies sticking to his hands. Now, rebel armies  punish him every minute for his treachery. The  soldiers he commands are only following orders.  They don’t fight because they love Macbeth. Now  he seems too small to be a great king, like a  midget trying to wear the robes of a giant.  
Act 5, Scene 2, Page 2  
MENTEITH 
 Who then shall blame

Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,  
And with him pour we in our country’s purge  Each drop of us.  
LENNOX 
 Or so much as it needs,  
30 
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.  Make we our march towards Birnam.  
CAITHNESS 
Well, let’s keep marching and give our loyalty to  someone who truly deserves it. We’re going to  meet Malcolm, the doctor who will cure our sick  country. We’ll pour out our own blood to help him.  
LENNOX 
However much blood we need to give to water  the royal flower and drown the weeds—to make  Malcolm king and get rid of Macbeth. Let’s  proceed on our march to Birnam.

MACBETH 
Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all.  Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane  
I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?  Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know  All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:  
5 
“Fear not, Macbeth. No man that’s born of woman  Shall e'er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false  thanes,  
And mingle with the English epicures.  
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear  
10 
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.  
MACBETH 
Don’t bring me any more reports. I don’t care if all  the thanes desert me. Until Birnam Wood gets up  and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by  fear. What’s the boy Malcolm? Wasn’t he born  from a woman? The spirits that know the future  have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth. No  man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So  get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English! My mind and courage will  never falter with doubt or shake with fear.

Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.  Seyton!  
Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton,  come here!—This battle will either secure my  reign forever or else topple me from the throne. I  have lived long enough. The course of my life is  beginning to wither and fall away, like a yellowing leaf in autumn. The things that should go along  with old age, like honor, love, obedience, and  loyal friends, I cannot hope to have.

Throw physic to the dogs; I’ll none of it.

Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff.  Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the thanes fly from me.  Come, sir, dispatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast  The water of my land, find her disease,  
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,  55 
I would applaud thee to the very echo,  
That should applaud again.—Pull ’t off, I say.—  What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,  Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of  them?  
DOCTOR 
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation  Makes us hear something.  
60 
MACBETH 
 Bring it after me.  
I will not be afraid of death and bane,  
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.  
DOCTOR 
(aside) Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,  Profit again should hardly draw me here.  
DOCTOR 
For that kind of relief, the patient must heal  herself.  
MACBETH 
Medicine is for the dogs. I won’t have anything to  do with it. (to SEYTON) Come, put my armor on  me. Give me my lance. Seyton, send out the  soldiers. (to the DOCTOR) Doctor, the thanes are  running away from me. (to SEYTON) Come on,  sir, hurry. (to the DOCTOR) Can you figure out  what’s wrong with my country? If you can  diagnose its disease by examining its urine, and  bring it back to health, I will praise you to the  ends of the Earth, where the sound will echo back  so you can hear the applause again.— (toSEYTON) Pull it off, I tell you. (to  
the DOCTOR)What drug would purge the English  from this country? Have you heard of any?  DOCTOR 
Yes, my good lord. Your preparation for war  sounds like something.  
MACBETH 
(to SEYTON) Bring the armor and follow me. I will  not be afraid of death and destruction until  Birnam forest picks itself up and moves to  Dunsinane.  
DOCTOR 
(to himself) I wish I were far away from  Dunsinane. You couldn’t pay me to come back  here.

MALCOLM 
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand  That chambers will be safe.  
MENTEITH 
 We doubt it nothing.  
SIWARD 
What wood is this before us?  
MENTEITH 
 The wood of Birnam.  
MALCOLM 
Let every soldier hew him down a bough  5 
And bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow  The numbers of our host and make discovery  Err in report of us.  
SOLDIERS 
 It shall be done.  
SIWARD 
We learn no other but the confident tyrant  Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure  1 
Our setting down before ’t.

MALCOLM 
 'Tis his main hope:  
For, where there is advantage to be given,  Both more and less have given him the revolt,  And none serve with him but constrainèd things  Whose hearts are absent too.  
MACDUFF 
 Let our just censures  
1 
Attend the true event, and put we on  
5 
Industrious soldiership.  
MALCOLM 
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be  safe in their own bedrooms.  
MENTEITH 
We don’t doubt it.  
SIWARD 
What’s the name of this forest behind us?  
MENTEITH 
Birnam Wood.  
MALCOLM 
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in  front of him. That way we can conceal how many of us  there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate  reports.  
SOLDIERS 
We’ll do it.  
SIWARD 
We have no news except that the overconfident  Macbeth is still in Dunsinane and will allow us to lay  siege to the castle.  
MALCOLM 
He wants us to lay siege. Wherever his soldiers have an  opportunity to leave him, they do, whatever rank they  are. No one fights with him except men who are forced  to, and their hearts aren’t in it.  
MACDUFF 
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our  goal. Let’s go fight like hardworking soldiers.  
Act 5, Scene 4, Page 2  
SIWARD 
 The time approaches  
That will with due decision make us know  What we shall say we have and what we owe.  Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,  
SIWARD 
Soon we’ll find out what’s really ours and what  isn’t. It’s easy for us to get our hopes up just  sitting around thinking about it, but the only way  this is really going to be settled is by violence. So  
20 
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.  Towards which, advance the war.

Hang out our banners on the outward walls.  The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie  Till famine and the ague eat them up.

MACBETH 
Hang our flags on the outer walls. Everyone  keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is  strong enough to laugh off their seige. They can  sit out there until they die of hunger and disease. If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our

soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have  met them out in front of the castle, man to man,  and beaten them back to England.  
A cry within of women A sound of women crying offstage.  
 What is that noise? What’s that noise?  
SEYTON 
It is the cry of women, my good lord.  
MACBETH 
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.  
10 
The time has been my senses would have cooled  To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair  Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir  As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.  Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts  Cannot once start me.  
15 
SEYTON 
It’s women crying, my good lord.  
Exit SEYTON exits.  MACBETH 
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like. There  was a time when I would have been terrified by a  shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would  have stood up when I heard a ghost story. But  now I’ve had my fill of real horrors. Horrible things  are so familiar that they can’t startle me.  
Enter SEYTON SEYTON comes back in.  
Wherefore was that cry? What was that cry for?  
SEYTON 
The queen, my lord, is dead.

 She should have died hereafter.  There would have been a time for such a word.  Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,  
SEYTON 
The queen is dead, my lord.  
MACBETH 
She would have died later anyway. That news  was bound to come someday. Tomorrow, and  tomorrow, and tomorrow. The days creep slowly  
20 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day  To the last syllable of recorded time,  
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!  Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage  
25 
And then is heard no more. It is a tale  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  Signifying nothing.  
along until the end of time. And every day that’s  already happened has taken fools that much  closer to their deaths. Out, out, brief candle. Life  is nothing more than an illusion. It’s like a poor  actor who struts and worries for his hour on the  stage and then is never heard from again. Life is  a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional  disturbance but devoid of meaning.

 Thou comest to use  
Thy tongue; thy story quickly.  
MESSENGER 
 Gracious my lord,  
I should report that which I say I saw,  But know not how to do ’t.  
MACBETH 
 Well, say, sir.  
MESSENGER 
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,  I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought  The wood began to move.  
MACBETH 
 Liar and slave!  
You’ve come to tell me something. Tell me  quickly.  
MESSENGER 
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.

Just say it.

Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive  Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,  
Punish me if it’s not true. Three miles from here  you can see it coming, a moving forest.

Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—  If this which he avouches does appear,  
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.  I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,  
And wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone.—  Ring the alarum-bell!—Blow, wind! Come, wrack!

At least we’ll die with harness on our back.  
confidence is failing. I’m starting to doubt the lies  the devil told me, which sounded like truth. “Don’t worry until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.”  And now a wood is coming to Dunsinane.  Prepare for battle, and go! If what this messenger  says is true, it’s no use running away or staying  here. I’m starting to grow tired of living, and I’d like to see the world plunged into chaos. Ring the  alarms! Blow, wind! Come, ruin! At least we’ll die  with our armor on.

We’re close enough now. Throw down these  branches and show them who you really are.  Uncle Siward, you and your son will lead the first  battle. Brave Macduff and I will do the rest,  according to our battle plan.

That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!  If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,  My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.  I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms  20 
Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,  Or else my sword with an unbattered edge  I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;  By this great clatter, one of the greatest note  Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,  
25 
And more I beg not.  
MACDUFF 
The noise is coming from over there. Tyrant,  show your face! If someone other than me kills  you, the ghosts of my wife and children will haunt  me forever. I can’t be bothered to fight these lame soldiers who only fight for money. I’ll either fight  you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword  unused. You must be over there. By the great  noise, it sounds like one of the highest-ranking  men is being announced. I hope I find him! I ask  for nothing more than that.  
SIWARD 
Exit. Alarums MACDUFF exits. More battle noises.  Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD MALCOLM and old SIWARD enter.  SIWARD

And little is to do.

MALCOLM 
 We have met with foes  
Come this way, my lord. The castle has been  surrendered without a fight. Macbeth’s soldiers  are fighting on both sides. Our noblemen are  battling bravely. The victory is almost yours, and  it seems like there’s not much left to do.  MALCOLM

Why should I play the Roman fool and die  On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes  Do better upon them.  
Why should I commit suicide like one of the  ancient Romans? As long as I see enemies of  mine alive, I would rather see my sword wound  them than me.

Enter MACDUFF MACDUFF enters.  MACDUFF 
Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!

You are the only man I have avoided. But go  
But get thee back. My soul is too much charged  
5  
With blood of thine already.  
MACDUFF 
 I have no words.  
My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villain  Than terms can give thee out!  
away now. I’m already guilty of killing your whole  family.  
MACDUFF 
I have nothing to say to you. My sword will talk for  me. You are too evil for words!  
MACBETH 
 Thou losest labor.  As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air

You’re wasting your time trying to wound me. You  might as well try to stab the air with your sword.

With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;  
I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield  To one of woman born.  
MACDUFF 
 Despair thy charm,  
And let the angel whom thou still hast served  Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb  
15 
Untimely ripped.  
Go fight someone who can be harmed. I lead a  charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone  born from a woman.  
MACDUFF 
You can forget about your charm. The evil spirit  you serve can tell you that I was not born. They  cut me out of my mother’s womb before she  could bear me naturally.  
Act 5, Scene 8, Page 2  
MACBETH 
Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so,  For it hath cowed my better part of man!  And be these juggling fiends no more believed,  
MACBETH 
Curse you for telling me this. You’ve fightened  away my courage. I don’t believe those evil  creatures anymore. They tricked me with their

That palter with us in a double sense,  That keep the word of promise to our ear,  And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee. MACDUFF 
Then yield thee, coward,  
And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.  We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,  Painted on a pole, and underwrit,  
wordgames, raising my hopes and then  destroying them. I won’t fight you.  
MACDUFF 
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a  freakshow, just like they do with deformed  animals. We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right  above the words “Come see the tyrant!” 
No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -71-   Original Text Modern Text  
“Here may you see the tyrant.”  
MACBETH 
 I will not yield,  
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,  And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.

Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,  And thou opposed, being of no woman born,  Yet I will try the last. Before my body  
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,

Some must go off. And yet, by these I see,  
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.  
MALCOLM 
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.  
ROSS 
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.  He only lived but till he was a man,  
40 
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed  In the unshrinking station where he fought,  
But like a man he died.  
MACBETH 
I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the  ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the  common people. Even though Birnam Wood  really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a  man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end. I’ll put  up my shield and battle you. Come on, let’s go at  it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries,  'Stop! Enough!'  
They exit fighting. Trumpets and battle noises.  The trumpet of one army sounds a call to retreat.  The other army’s trumpet sounds a call of victory.  The victorious army enters, led by MALCOLM,  old SIWARD, ROSS, the other THANES, and  soldiers, with a drummer and flag.  
MALCOLM 
I wish all of our friends could have survived this  battle.  
SIWARD 
In every battle, some people will always be killed, but judging from the men I see around us, our  great victory didn’t cost us very much.  MALCOLM 
Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.  ROSS 
My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price:  death. He only lived long enough to become a  man, and as soon as he proved that he was a  man by fighting like one, he died.  
Act 5, Scene 8, Page 3  
SIWARD 
 Then he is dead?  
ROSS 
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow 
SIWARD 
So he’s dead?  
ROSS 
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field. Your grief  
45 50 
Must not be measured by his worth, for then  It hath no end.  
SIWARD 
 Had he his hurts before?  ROSS 
Ay, on the front.  
SIWARD 
 Why then, God’s soldier be he!  Had I as many sons as I have hairs,  I would not wish them to a fairer death.  And so, his knell is knolled.  
MALCOLM 
 He’s worth more sorrow,  And that I’ll spend for him.  
should not be equal to his worth, because then  your sorrow would never end.  
SIWARD 
Were his wounds on his front side?  
ROSS 
Yes, on his front.  
SIWARD 
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now! If I had as  many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t  hope that any of them would die more honorably  than he did. And that’s all there is to it.  MALCOLM 
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will  mourn for him. 
No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -72-   Original Text Modern Text  
SIWARD 
 He’s worth no more.  
They say he parted well and paid his score.  And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

He is worth no more than that. They tell me he  died well, and settled his scores. With that, I hope  God is with him! Here comes better news.

Hail, king! Because that’s what you are now.  Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head. We  are free from his tyranny. I see that you have the  kingdom’s noblemen around you, and they’re  thinking the same thing as me. I want them to join  me in this loud cheer, Hail, King of Scotland!

So, thanks to all at once and to each one,

earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.  We have a lot to do at the dawn of this new era.  We must call home all of our exiled friends who  fled from the grip of Macbeth’s tyranny, and we  must bring to justice all the evil ministers of this  
dead butcher and his demon-like queen, who,  rumor has it, committed suicide. This, and  whatever else we are called to do by God, we will  do at the right time and in the right place. So I  thank you all, and I invite each and every one of  you to come watch me be crowned king of  Scotland at Scone.
